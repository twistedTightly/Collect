# Collect
**A beautiful website to preserve the past and build upon our personal histories, dedicated to archiving memories and shared experiences in order to adapt history to its most individualized expression.**

It is a repository that collects our past and a conceptual space that engages us in reconstructing our experiences and understanding how we’ve grown from them.


In the psychology of memory, **the best ways to preserve content is by framing it in a narrative** and using mnemonic tools to create a return to “metaphorical” place. These devices include a range of associative triggers—from narrative, to sights, place, engaging in other people’s memories, and sounds. Using these tools, I’ve designed an experience that helps people privately **manage their past by gathering personal memories and building shared recollection spaces** with friends and family. By incorporating digital materials in my concept—like photographs, videos, locations—I’ve attempted to increase dimensionality of each written thought and building synaptic loops that helps to improve memory by symbolically taking users back to each place. **In a sense, Collect strives to activate passive experiences.**
